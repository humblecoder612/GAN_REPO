# GAN Collection
> Generative Adversarial Network

I would upload my all GAN projects which is generating synthethic data through ML/AI , I am interested in this concepts.
So,I have learned basics on Fashion MNIST Data with some research.I am planning to generate Dog Images in my next GAN project and further.

## Installation

Libraries:

```
Tensorflow 2.XX
numpy
Matplot

```

## Usage example
DCGAN is one of the popular and successful network design for GAN. It mainly composes of convolution layers without max pooling or fully connected layers. It uses convolutional stride and transposed convolution for the downsampling and the upsampling.


## Release History

* 0.1.0
    * Upcoming project
    * Dog Images generating of Multiple Breeds
    
* 0.0.0
    * The first project release
    * Fashion MNIST dataset used, which is very much similar to the original Images using DCGAN
